            Innovative engineering leader with 12+ years of experience across
            DevOps, platform engineering, and developer experience (DevEx). I
            specialize in architecting scalable, cost-effective, multi-cloud
            platforms while building internal products that streamline developer
            workflows and boost team productivity. As a technical leader, I lead
            cross-functional teams and design DevEx-focused solutions that
            reduce friction, increase velocity, and align engineering outcomes
            with business goals.
            <br />
            <br />
            Passionate about AI, I integrate cutting-edge tools and frameworks
            into daily workflows to optimize coding, reporting, and technical
            decision-making. I am also spearheading our AI initiatives;
            architecting and implementing our agentic, generative AI solution
            into Venue.sh that transforms our developer portal into an
            intelligent, conversational interface. I bring a strategic mindset,
            hands-on technical leadership, and a proven track record of
            delivering impact across complex engineering ecosystems.
